# **Snake**
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Pygame library in Python. The objective of the game is to control the movement of the snake and eat the red apples while avoiding collisions with the walls or the snakeâ€™s own body.

## **Getting Started**
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## **Prerequisites**
1. Python 3.x
2. Pygame library
3. The fonts and audios used in the program

## **Installing**
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
**git clone https://github.com/yourUsername/Snake.git**

## **Running the Game**
Navigate to the project directory and run the following command in your terminal:
python3 Snake.py

## **How to Play**
Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake: up, down, left, and right.
The snake will move in the direction of the last arrow key pressed.
The objective of the game is to eat the red apples that appear on the screen to increase your score.
Each time you eat an apple, the snake will grow longer.
Avoid collisions with the walls or the snake's own body, as this will end the game.
The game will end when the snake collides with a wall or its own body.
You can play again by pressing any key after the game over screen appears.

## **Customization**
You can customize the game in different ways such as:
1. Window size: You can change the WINDOW_WIDTH and WINDOW_HEIGHT variables to adjust the size of the game window.
2. Snake size: You can change the SNAKE_SIZE variable to adjust the size of the snake and the apple.
3. Colors: You can change the values of the color variables to modify the appearance of the game elements.
4. Fonts: You can replace the AttackGraffiti.ttf font file with another font file of your choice.
5. Background image: You can replace the back.jpg image file with another image file of your choice.
6. Sound effects: You can replace the snake.wav sound file with another sound file of your choice.
